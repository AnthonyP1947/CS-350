Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I used built-in peripherals on the board to create a working thermostat that reacts to temperature changes and indicates if the heat is on or not by turning an led on for heat and off for not heating.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that my code is close to the example code in the lab but different in that i created easy to follow comments and variables to control things like the check for time and btn press interrupts. I also had to troubleshoot more than in other course and used a lot more outside sources than normal. I had to use a lot of resources to get to my final thought and stack overflow helped a lot. 

Where could you improve?
I need to spend more time in the planning stage and stay on schedule. I spent so much time working on past due projects due to misunderstanding the material. I also think i need to understand some of the peripherals. i think if i worked smarter and not harder i wouldn't have to rewrite projects more than once or twice. Almost every project including this one was recreated three to five times before it worked as expected or even ran due to poor setup or using the wrong sdk.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I'm using stack overflow and after noticing that the general discussions answered a lot of my questions i plan to utilize that as well.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think my understanding of peripherals and how to combine and have multiple things interact will be applicable to other projects in the future.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code in the project was well commented and the variables are easy to follow. One change i made due to seeing an example of a smartwatch on stack overflow is to not hard code the values in the control flow statements. It would be easy to go in and spot the variable to set the wait time compared to finding every line that needs to be updated.
